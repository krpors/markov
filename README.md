# Markov chain

Rust implementation of a Markov chain to generate random text based
on a certain input file.

It builds a Markov chain using this input file, and generates random
text based on the probabilities found in the given text. The more text,
the more random the outcome is.

## Example

Input:
```shell
markov --file input1.txt -a 100
```

Output:
```
